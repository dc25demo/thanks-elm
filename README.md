## CAUTION

When you use this app, you will be prompted by github to allow the app to work on your behalf.  This is necessary because the app will be starring repositories in your name.  Always think twice before granting such permission.  In fact, the best use for this app may be as a reference for others who wish to use oauth to work with the github API from within an Elm app.

🌟 Say thanks to everyone who helps build and maintain your Elm dependencies

Inspired by [this command line utility, "elm-thanks"](https://github.com/zwilias/elm-thanks) .  I wanted to see what it would take to implement the same functionality as a web app written in Elm.

As with "elm-thanks", the idea is to express our gratitude to the creators and maintainers of our dependencies by starring the github repositories. The original "elm-thanks" does that by looking for an elm-package.json file in the directory that it runs in.  The "thanks-elm" web app prompts the user to choose an elm-package.json file.
