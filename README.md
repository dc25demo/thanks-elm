Inspired by [this command line utility, "elm-thanks"](https://github.com/zwilias/elm-thanks) .  I wanted to see what it would take to implement the same functionality as a web app written in Elm.

As with "elm-thanks", the idea is to express our gratitude to the creators and maintainers of our dependencies by starring the github repositories. The original "elm-thanks" does that by looking for an elm-package.json file in the directory that it runs in.  The "thanks-elm" web app prompts the user to choose an elm-package.json file.

Click here to run the app: [https://dc25demo.github.io/thanks-elm](https://dc25demo.github.io/thanks-elm).
